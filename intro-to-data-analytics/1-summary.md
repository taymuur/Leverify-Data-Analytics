### How humans are better than computers?

Even though computers are good at decision-making and can tackle unseen situations better than humans, the computers lack the ability to see beyond what is visible.


### Ethical concerns

* Individuals own the data that has been collected from them
* If an individual's personal data is used, they should have transparent access to the process where the data is used and the insights that are generated.
